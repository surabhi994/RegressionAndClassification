Implemented the following regression models in Python using the numpy library to analyze the given data -
1. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
2. Linear Regression Model -Implemented ordinary least squares method to estimate regression parameters by minimizing the squared loss.
3. Ridge Regression- implemented parameter estimation for ridge regression by minimizing the regularized squared loss 
4.Using Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression 
5.Non-linear Regression- Investigating the impact of using higher order polynomials for the input features.
